			the wind of autumn. It is cool and comfortable. When the wind kisses my face, I will close my eyes and
			smile. I know that wind brings me the breath of autumn. She lets me understand that autumn is full of
			happiness. I can smell and taste autumn everywhere. The view of the autumn will give me a huge
			enjoyment. As
			for me, the wind in autumn is the best present. I am deeply attracted by the autumn wind. This taste of
			autumn is delicious. I also love autumn colors. The leaves will turn yellow in autumn. This kind of
			yellow
			represents hope and maturity. When I see these yellow leaves, I will think that they still enter into
			the
			soil and will give the tree adequate nutrition. Thus, they never leave the tree. I am moved by this
			sentiment. This phenomenon gives me many thoughts about human society. I believe that our society will
			have
			a better development if we realize that we should have a grateful heart. Autumn colors are so magical
			for
			me. They let me have bigger imagination space to think over life. I know this taste of autumn is sweet.
			I
			really appreciate autumn quality. In my eyes, autumn is just a mature person. And her love requires no
			return. In this season, when I walk on the way, I can feel her sincerity and her firmness. Although she
			can’t speak one word, I can learn something from her. This taste of autumn is pregnant and attractive.
